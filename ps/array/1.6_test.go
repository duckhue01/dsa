// string compression: implement a method to perform basic string compression
// using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3,
// if the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string
// your method should return the original string. You can assume the string as only uppercase
// and lowercase letters(a-z)
